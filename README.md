###Description
CHATTER is a real-time mobile chat app using Firebase's powerful API to store and sync data instantly. The app is built leveraging the Ionic Framework and Angular JS to create a hybrid webapp with a truly native-like experience. The app is written solely using client side web technology wrapped in Cordova's magic allowing access to the phone's sensors and hardware. This approach enables CHATTER and many applications like it to be built quickly without the need for writing natively, as well as server side code in this case.

###User Stories
You can find feature sets and my breakdown of CHATTER's user experience here on Waffle.io, Github's version of Trello. [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/alexhidalgo/PropChat.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/alexhidalgo/PropChat)
